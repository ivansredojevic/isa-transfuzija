Here is an example of how to enable HTTPS on a Spring Boot backend¹:

1. Get yourself an SSL certificate: generate a self-signed certificate or get one from a Certificate Authority.
2. Enable HTTPS in Spring Boot.

```java
server.port=8443
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:keystore.p12
server.ssl.key-store-password=secret
server.ssl.keyStoreType=PKCS12
server.ssl.keyAlias=tomcat
```

I hope this helps!

Here is an example of how to configure SSL certificate in your Angular app¹:

1. Generate an SSL certificate.
2. Install the certificate to a local Certificate Authority (CA).
3. Configure the Angular CLI to use your generated certificate.

```javascript
ng serve --ssl true --ssl-key /path/to/key.pem --ssl-cert /path/to/cert.pem
```

I hope this helps!
